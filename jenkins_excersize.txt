1. Create a repository in your github account called "jenkins_test"
2. Commit a python project to that repo which has some python tests.
        - grab any example of how to test python.
        - add just one test that succeeds.
        - test on the command line to see that everything works.
3. Configure jenkins with a project and a pipeline which pulls from
        your repository.
4. Trigger a jenkins build on that project via the jenkins web gui.
5. Commit a change to the python repo that breaks the tests.
6. Repeat stage 4 and ask jenkins to build. See the build fail and the
        reasons why.
